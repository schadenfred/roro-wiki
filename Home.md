Rolling your web application into source control using a service like Github or Bitbucket, and from there onto Heroku, can be a solid way to prototype. But once you have a real business with customers and traffic, it can get complicated and expensive and the people who own SalesForce -- the company that bought Heroku a few years back -- have always understood the power of [vendor lock in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).

RoRo is not a service that can lock you in. 

RoRo is a set of tools and conventions to help you use, develop, and share development stories with your team and the open source community writ large. 

Right now, RoRo offers a series of stories for creating a containerized Rails app for development using Docker Compose, a sequel that puts that same app into a CI/CD pipeline, and a part three for deploying that puts it all into to a kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean. 

There will be other stories, trilogies and epics. 

Perhaps you will write one?
