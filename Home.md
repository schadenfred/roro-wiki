Rolling your web application from source control onto Heroku is a solid way to ship prototypes and identify early customers. But once you have a real business with lots of customers and traffic, and the company that owns Heroku knows a thing or two about [vendor lock in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).

RoRo is not a service that can lock you in. 

RoRo is a set of tools and conventions to help you use, develop, and share development stories with your team and the open source community writ large. 

Right now, RoRo offers a series of stories for creating a containerized Rails app for development using Docker Compose, a sequel putting that same app into a CI/CD pipeline, and a part three deploying it to Digital Ocean using Kubernetes. 

There will be other stories, trilogies, sagas and epics. 

Perhaps you will write one.
